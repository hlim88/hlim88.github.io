	       <h1>Research Interests</h1>
          <p> My primary research interest is working at the interface of gravitational phyaiscs and astrophysics.
          Especially, I am interested in studying thd dynamics of compact object such as black holes (BHs) and
          neutron stars (NSs) using the tools ot numerical relativity. These compact objects are among the best
          candidate sources for graviataional waves (GWs). Recently, Advanced LIGO and VIRGO have detected GWs
          from binary black hole (BBH) mergers and a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Using GW, it now becomes
          possible to explore numerous high energy phenomena in the Universe. In my research, I study these 
          objects to investigate different implications provided by and for GWs</p>

        <h2>GW waveforms from exotic merger scenario</h2>

        <h2>Ejecta from merging NSs and WDs</h2>
		
		<h2>Toolkits</h2>
         <p> I am using various toolkits for my work</p>
         <p> I am also developing/implementing different codes/tools actively including:</p>

        <p> Another research I am working is finding a better way to solve hyperbolic PDEs numerically especially by
        using PC-FEM</p>
