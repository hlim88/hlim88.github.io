          <p> My primary research interest is working at the interface of gravitational phyaiscs and astrophysics.
          Especially, I am interested in studying thd dynamics of compact object such as black holes (BHs) and
          neutron stars (NSs) using the tools ot numerical relativity. These compact objects are among the best
          candidate sources for graviataional waves (GWs). Recently, Advanced LIGO and VIRGO have detected GWs
          from binary black hole (BBH) mergers and a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Using GW, it now becomes
          possible to explore numerous high energy phenomena in the Universe. In my research, I study these 
          objects to investigate different implications provided by and for GWs<br>

          Another research interest is working on mathematical analysis of numerical method for solving partial 
          differential equations (PDEs). Particularly, I am developed the Time Decomposition (TD) method as a variant 
          Domain Decomposition (DD) method for hyperbolic PDEs. This method is used as preconditioner (PC) for 
          Krylov space iterative methods such as GMRES and BICGSTAB with space-time finite element discretizationa.
          Using this method, I succesfully solved the semilinear wave equation and observed critical collapse from
          smooth initial data.<br>

          I am also interested in developing new algorithms and codes for massively parallel simulations for 
          multi-scale physics problem. 
          As an effort, I am a part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) which is collaborated effort of the US
          Department of Energy under Next Generation Code (NGC) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br>

          Below subsections show details about research

        <h3> Graviational physics/Astrophysics </h3>

		<h4>Beyond GR</h4>
        <p> Einstein's theory of gravity i.e. general relativity has been successfully
            tested in the weak field regime. However, strong field regime tests are 
            required so it is natural question to ask beyond general relativity.<br>
            In this work, I study different alternative theories of gravity which is
            motivated by low energy limit of the bosonic sector of heterotic string
            theory and quadratic gravity.<br>
            We are searching stabilities of dynamical black holes as well as possible
            alternate scalar electromagnetic field channels for emission. Furthermore,
            we investigate BBH mergers in order to probe deviations from the standard
            GW from signature of general relativity
        </p>

        <h4>GW waveforms from exotic merger scenario</h4>
        <p> Numerical relativiy plays an important rule to generate GW waveform
            aLIGO/VIRGO. However, there remain a number of open questions. Nearly
            equal mass BH binaries have been extensively studied in recent years.
            However, configurations with larger mass ratio BH binaries remain 
            beyond the capabilites of current techniques in numerical relativity.<br>

            In this work, we try to simulate intermediate mass ratio inspiral (IMRI)
            BH binaries using sparse wavelet adaptive multiresolution scheme.
            this can be target source for LIGO and future space-based GW detectors

        <p> Mergers of BNS (and also WD companion) have several interesting aspects.
            They are the primary candidates for GWs, source of GRBs, and the birth 
            place of rare earth materials.<br>

            Particulary, understanding the ejecta from mergers is interseting because
            rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis powers isotropic electromagnetic
            emission that is observable

        <h3>Time Decomposition Method </h3>
        <p> Time-dependent partial differential equations are described the nature
            from microscopic quantum world to large scale universe. So solving PDEs
            are required to understanding various phenomena.<br>

            Unfortunately, most of PDEs cannot be solved analytically so using
            feasible numerical methods play an key role to study the PDEs.<br>

            In this work, we study a time decomposition method based on space-time
            finitie element discretization. This method is suitable for solving 
            hyperbolic PDE which has finite charcteristic lines.<br>

            Using this method, we modeled simple Klein-Gordon equation with source
            and critical collapse of wave equation from smooth initial data.
