          <p> My primary research interest is working at the interface of gravitational phyaiscs and astrophysics.
          Especially, I am interested in studying thd dynamics of compact object such as black holes (BHs) and
          neutron stars (NSs) using the tools ot numerical relativity. These compact objects are among the best
          candidate sources for graviataional waves (GWs). Recently, Advanced LIGO and VIRGO have detected GWs
          from binary black hole (BBH) mergers and a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Using GW, it now becomes
          possible to explore numerous high energy phenomena in the Universe. In my research, I study these 
          objects to investigate different implications provided by and for GWs<br>

          Another research interest is working on mathematical analysis of numerical method for solving partial 
          differential equations (PDEs). Particularly, I am developed the Time Decomposition (TD) method as a variant 
          Domain Decomposition (DD) method for hyperbolic PDEs. This method is used as preconditioner (PC) for 
          Krylov space iterative methods such as GMRES and BICGSTAB with space-time finite element discretizationa.
          Using this method, I succesfully solved the semilinear wave equation and observed critical collapse from
          smooth initial data.<br>

          I am also interested in developing new algorithms and codes for massively parallel simulations for 
          multi-scale physics problem. 
          As an effort, I am a part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) which is collaborated effort of the US
          Department of Energy under Next Generation Code (NGC) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br>
